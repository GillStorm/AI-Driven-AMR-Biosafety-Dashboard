# AI-Driven-AMR-Biosafety-Dashboard
A Machine Learning Dashboard for Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance, Trend Analysis, and Biosafety Risk Evaluation

This project is an AI-powered biosurveillance system that analyzes Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) trends using clinical datasets, global antibiotic usage statistics, and machine learning.
It provides:

📊 Resistance trends

🧬 ML-based AMR predictions

⚠️ Biosafety risk scores

🌍 One-Health context using OWID antibiotic usage

🧪 Interactive visualizations

🧾 Auto-generated insights

The entire workflow is deployed as a Streamlit dashboard with modern UI, Lottie animations, and interactive controls.

🚀 Features
🧠 Machine Learning

RandomForestRegressor for AMR prediction

OneHotEncoding + Pipeline for clean preprocessing

R² & RMSE performance metrics

Predicts future resistance rate

Generates AMR Risk Score (0–100)

📊 Visual Analytics

Pathogen × Antibiotic heatmaps

Resistance rate vs. time trend plots

High-risk combinations table

Interactive filters

🌍 One-Health Integration

Merges AMR dataset with:

OWID antibiotic usage in children

OWID livestock antibiotic consumption (tonnes)

This provides deeper insight into environmental & human-driven AMR pressure.

🖥️ Modern Web Dashboard

Built using Streamlit with:

Lottie animations

Responsive layout

File uploader

Sidebar controls

Real-time model predictions
